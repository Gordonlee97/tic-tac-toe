# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI Project

A clean, interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe** web game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, developed collaboratively with **AI coding assistance** via **Cursor**.  
This project was created as an experiment in **prompt engineering** and **AI-assisted development**, showcasing modern workflows for building simple games efficiently and clearly.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Classic 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe** gameplay (Player vs Player)
- 💡 **Responsive UI** – works seamlessly on desktop and mobile
- 🎨 **Modern design** with clean styling and animations
- 🧠 **AI-assisted development workflow** documented in commits
- ⚙️ **Bug fixes and iterative improvements** through structured AI prompts

## 🧩 Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **HTML5** | Game layout and structure |
| **CSS3** | Styling and animations |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | Core game logic and interactions |
| **Git + GitHub** | Version control and project collaboration |
| **Cursor IDE** | AI-powered development and experimentation |

---

## 📘 Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player **X** and Player **O** take turns marking empty squares.
3. The first player to align **three of their marks** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 squares are filled with no winner, the game ends in a **draw**.

## 🧠 Development Notes

This project was built iteratively through **AI-assisted coding** using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/).  
Each feature and fix was guided by carefully engineered prompts to test how AI can assist in:

- Designing modular JavaScript logic
- Debugging browser runtime errors
- Improving accessibility and visual design
- Writing human-readable, maintainable code

You can view the full development journey in the commit history.

🧪 **Example Improvements (AI Iterations)**

| Iteration | Description |
|---|---|
| v1.0 | Basic game logic implemented (player turns, win check) |
| v1.1 | Fixed “reset button not clearing board” bug |
| v1.2 | Improved responsive CSS and hover interactions |
| v1.3 | Added AI-assisted refactor for cleaner code and better DOM handling |
| v1.4 | Human testing applied to ensure all edge cases work correctly and gameplay is intuitive |

🧑‍💻 **About the Developer**

This project was created by Gordon Lee, a software engineer transitioning into AI-focused development. It represents a hands-on exploration of AI-enhanced software workflows, where prompt engineering, debugging, and human testing combine to produce robust and intuitive applications.

⭐ **Future Enhancements**

*   Add single-player mode with basic AI opponent
*   Implement score tracking and game history
*   Add dark mode
*   Improve mobile UI for enhanced touch interactions
*   Include sound and/or haptic feedback
