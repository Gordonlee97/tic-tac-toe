## 📘 Game Rules

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Player **X** and Player **O** take turns marking empty squares.
3. The first player to align **three of their marks** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 squares are filled with no winner, the game ends in a **draw**.

## 🧠 Development Notes

This project was built iteratively through **AI-assisted coding** using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/).  
Each feature and fix was guided by carefully engineered prompts to test how AI can assist in:

- Designing modular JavaScript logic
- Debugging browser runtime errors
- Improving accessibility and visual design
- Writing human-readable, maintainable code

You can view the full development journey in the commit history.
